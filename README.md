# fin(e)ance
A financial dashboard PWA (Progressive Web App) build on the MERN Stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
  
with a modern CSS styling, CI (Github Actions) with automated testing and CD on render (backend) and vercel (frontend) and much more.

# Installation
Usable on desktop and mobile, although the layout currently is more polished on mobile. Just visit: https://fin-e-ance-simon-gns-projects.vercel.app/ and sign up. Also, you can install the app on mobile by visiting the url and select "Add to Home screen" in the "three dot" menu of the browser. Your browser might already ask you to install the app upon visiting the url.

# TODO:
There are many more "nice-to-have" features I'd really like to implement and some current features definitely need improvements to some extend. But this project was intended primarily as a learning project to improve my skills as a Full Stack Developer, so those implementations and improvements have to wait. Yet, improvements to the CSS styling and layout will happen in the near future.
